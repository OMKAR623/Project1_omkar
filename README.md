# HDFS-and-Hive

For this Big-data project, I took the web-series data from Kaggle website, and converted that data into CSV file. The dataset contains 9 columns and 12500 rows approximately. Then using Ambari I imported the CSV file data into HDFS. After that I created one database and table inside that database using Hive. Then I loaded the web-series data into the Hive table and finally did some analysis on that dataset with the help of Hive queries. And also stored the output of Hive queries back into HDFS.
